 <h3>Research</h3>
  <p> My research is focused on designing human-canine interactions that optimize objective functions
      with both canine satisfaction and human attention components. My work thus far includes in vivo
      studies of graduate students in their natural habitat, evaluation of the swarm dynamics of microhumans
      and quadrupeds in unstructured environments, and work on the rising use of social media for
      remote human-canine interactions. In my work, I hope to answer basic questions like, "Why are humans
      so obsessed with me?" and "What do I have to do to get a treat?"
