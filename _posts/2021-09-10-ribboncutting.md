The new [ME Knowledge Lab](https://news.psu.edu/story/669468/2021/09/15/academics/ribbon-cutting-marks-new-era-mechanical-engineering-undergraduates), just down the hall from the Human-Centered Robotics Lab, celebrated its official opening on September 10th. The ribbon cutting ceremony including demonstrations of the teaching labs as well as our own newly renovated space. [Zhiqing Lu](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/zhiqinglu) showed off the newly installed Kuka iiwa LBR with some examples of the robot high-fiving, waving, and dancing with visitors to the department.
