  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>This is my third year as part of the Human Centered Robotics lab. My research was previously focused on the creation and making of a VR haptic glove that is intended to be used by  individuals to provide stimulated physical feedback when a user interacts with an object while in a VR environment. The creation of the glove will be based heavily on the work of an open-source user on GitHub; this provides the foundations of the structure. Now that the mechanical design is complete, my focus has been centered on the implemntation of the glove within unity and performing testing in collaboration with a masters student thesis project.</p>
