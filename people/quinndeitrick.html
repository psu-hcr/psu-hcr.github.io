  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>My research focuses on making robotic assistive devices more accessible 
  to everyone. I am currently helping to design and construct a low-cost
  haptic feedback device that utilizes symbolic signaling to assist users
  complete a wide range of simpler tasks. This can range from assisting
  people with disabilities achieve their therapeutic exercises, as well as
  aiding in remote training. My goal is to be able to help bridge the gap
  between human-robotic interactions, through using an accessible, effective
  device. </p>
