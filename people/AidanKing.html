  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>This is my first semester as part of the Human Centered Robotics lab. Currently, my research
   is focused on the creation and making of a VR haptic glove that is intended to be used by 
   individuals to provide stimulated physical feedback when a user interacts with an object
   while in a VR environment. The creation of the glove will be based heavily on the work of
   an open-source user on GitHub; this provides the foundations of the structure. However, 
   over the course of the semester, I will focus the majority of my time on the creation of a structure 
   to hold our VR remote and ways to increase the adjustability of the original design. </p>
