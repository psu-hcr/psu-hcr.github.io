<h1>Prof. Fitz’s Personal Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h1>

<body>
	
	<p>My brother, Matt, has a smile that can light up a room, the work ethic of a 
		marathoner, and quadriplegia. The 6th of eight children, Matt’s accident and long 
		recovery introduced our family to incredible therapists and cutting-edge technology
		and research. These experiences inspired me to pursue research in biomechanics as an
		undergraduate and work in human-robot interaction as a PhD student. Though my 
		research will likely never have a direct impact on my brother, it is because of him
		that I am passionate about removing barriers to the independence, quality of life, 
		and active community participation of persons with disabilities. It also opened my 
		eyes to the importance of inclusion of all underrepresented groups in academic and
		professional environments. </p>
		<p>While my brother’s disability prompted my interests in biology and robotics, it also
		caused a great deal of financial and personal stresses within my family. I was 
		fortunate to receive financial and academic support from organizations and 
		scholarships that aimed to promote diversity in STEM. Throughout my academic career, 
		I have worked to support others like myself, often through mentorship programs 
		organized by SWE or by advising high school students from my small hometown on topics
		such as college, scholarship/fellowship applications, and graduate school. In my roles
		as Vice President of Tau Beta Pi and Vice President of Pi Tau Sigma, I organized 
		volunteers for STEM nights at local high schools and elementary schools in addition 
		to volunteer activities with the local Ronald McDonald House.</p>
		My work and background in robotics and biology are accessible and interesting topics
		for K-12 students. Therefore, I have had frequent opportunities to share my research
		with members of the public through tours of the 
		<a href="https://www.robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>
		and an annual 2-day exhibit at Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry, where our 
		our work is seen by thousands of visitors. As a faculty, I hope to continue 
		participating in activities that increase the participation of underrepresented 
		minorities in STEM through community outreach, activities in my lab, and in my role 
		as a teacher.</p>

		<p>When I first wrote this statement, the world felt very different to me than it does 
		now. The pandemic and outcries for racial justice have highlighted inequities that 
		have existed for as long as this country has existed. Therefore, I have decided that
		it is important to reaffirm my commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and 
		inclusion in any small way that I can. My brother taught me compassion and empathy,
		and I will strive to bring that compassion and empathy to my role as an advisor and
		a teacher at Penn State.
